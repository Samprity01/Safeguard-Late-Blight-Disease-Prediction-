# Safeguard-Late-Blight-Disease-Prediction-
Basically provides the configurations and statistical calculation to understand the diseases prediction similarities and predict the diseases in easier waay and also accuracy.Agriculture is a cornerstone of India's economy, constituting 20.19% of its GDP. Tomatoes, as the 
country's leading agricultural export, face challenges due to climatic factors and diseases, with leaf 
disease significantly impacting crop yield and quality. This paper presents an innovative machine 
learning approach, leveraging the Decision Tree algorithm, to predict Late Blight Disease in tomato 
leaves. A comprehensive dataset encompassing various leaf attributes was collected and used for model 
training. The Decision Tree, chosen for its interpretability and capacity to capture intricate data 
relationships, underwent rigorous evaluation via cross-validation. This research advances precision 
agriculture by offering a dependable tool for early disease detection, enabling timely interventions and 
minimizing crop losses. The simplicity and effectiveness of the Decision Tree algorithm enhance its value 
in sustainable farming practices. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of our method, 
surpassing existing literature-based approaches. This work heralds a promising path towards 
safeguarding India's vital tomato crop and bolstering agricultural sustainability.
